# Amnesia

To comply with laws, which protect the “right to be forgotten” and delete customer data from ML models (considered to be a lossy, compressed version of customer data), 
Amnesia enables users to decrementally update trained ML models (for recommendation, classification, and regression), thereby forgetting the data of a customer without necessitating model retraining.
